    Procedural Programming
Procedural Programming is a programming style that is based on a set of procedures or functions, where each function is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task. It focuses on the sequence of must-follow steps that to accomplish a specific task. In contrast, OOP focuses on the objects and their interactions to solve problems.

Functional Programming
Functional Programming is a programming style that focuses on the use of functions that produce output based on their input, without modifying any external state. It is based on mathematical functions and is characterized by immutability and statelessness. In contrast, OOP is based on objects and their states, and it is designed to manage complex, stateful systems.

Benefits of OOP over other programming
Here are some key differences between OOP and other programming styles:

Data and behavior: OOP is based on the idea of encapsulating data and behavior within objects, whereas procedural programming separates data and behavior into different functions or procedures. Functional programming, on the other hand, treats data and behavior as separate entities altogether.
Inheritance and code reuse: OOP uses inheritance to reuse code and build complex systems. Procedural programming and functional programming do not have inheritance concepts built into them.
Flexibility: OOP is more flexible than procedural programming because it allows for changes to be made to the underlying data structures and objects without changing the entire system. In contrast, procedural programming requires a complete restructuring of the program if any changes are made.
OOP enables encapsulation, inheritance, code reusability, and flexibility, making it a powerful tool for building complex, stateful systems.

Best Practices for OOP Concepts in Java
The goal of OOP concepts in Java is to save time without sacrificing security and ease of use. The following best practices are all oriented toward advancing that main goal.

DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). A core concept in Java, DRY simply means you should never have two blocks of identical code in two different places. Instead, have one method you use for different applications.
If you expect your Java code to change in the future, encapsulate it by making all variables and methods private at the outset. As the code changes, increase access to “protected” as needed, but not too public.
Single Responsibility. This best practice principle for OOP concepts in Java states that a class should always have only one functionality. That way, the class can be called and/or extended on its own when new uses arise for it, without causing coupling between different functionalities.
Open Closed Design. Make all methods and classes Closed for modification but Open for an extension. That way, tried and tested code can remain static but can be modified to perform new tasks as needed.
For a good, full list of best practices for OOP concepts in Java, see this blog post. You can also check out our article about OOP concepts in C#.

These concepts and best practices are only as great as the developers that implement them. To make your work better, you need productivity tools to improve your Java programming.
